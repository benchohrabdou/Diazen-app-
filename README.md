## Final-Year Project – 2025  


---

##  Overview  
This mobile application assists diabetic patients in managing **Functional Insulin Therapy (FIT)**.  
It provides structured tracking of meals, carbohydrates, physical activity, and blood glucose levels, along with a module for calculating **prandial insulin doses** based on FIT principles.

This project was developed as part of my **Bachelor’s final-year project** and serves as the foundation for a potential **e-health startup solution**.
